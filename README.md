# Dependencies

- Works with ```Python 3.7``` 
- You'll need the following libraries: ```Numpy```, ```Pandas```, ```Bokeh``` and ```Streamlit```
- I recommend using [Anaconda's Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda has ```Numpy``` and ```Pandas``` installed.
- You'll need to install ```Bokeh``` and ```Streamlit``` using the following commands:

* ```conda install -c bokeh bokeh```
 * ```pip install streamlit```
